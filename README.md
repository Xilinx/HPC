# HPC Accelerators and Applications
## Introduction
The HPC repository provides the FPGA-based accelerators and applications for HPC workload. The accelerators are hardware logics implmented with cusomized Vitis library components. The applications provide system-level solutions, including software-level optimizations and integration interfaces with third-party systems. The accelerators reside in L2 directory. The applications reside in L3 directory. 

## Accelerators
Following hardware accelerator designs are provided.
* Dense layer + activation layer/linear layer for MLP (support float32 data type)
* Preconditioned conjugate gradient solver (support float64 data type)

## Applications
